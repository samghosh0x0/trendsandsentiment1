News Trend and Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing in Python
This is a simple fun project of collecting news articles from different news websites and then performing trend and sentiment analysis.

Please update the data collection files if needed. 

Now, the "trendanalysisrssfeed.py" file contains a similar application. It uses RSS feeds to collect data from news websites and does trend analysis. No sentiment analysis. It updates a mysql database with the new trends.
